# Birds is a tuple of tuples of length three: latin name, common name, mass.
# write a (short) script to print these on a separate line or output block by species 
# Hints: use the "print" command! You can use list comprehension!

# ANNOTATE WHAT EVERY BLOCK OR IF NECESSARY, LINE IS DOING! 

# ALSO, PLEASE INCLUDE A DOCSTRING AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILE THAT 
# SAYS WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES AND WHO THE AUTHOR IS
